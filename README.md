#Weatherly

Weatherly is a pair project during the second module of Turing School of Software and Design's Front End Development program. 

It has been our first project working with React, and the first project requiring us to make an API call. 

We get the data from www.weatherunderground.com and parse it into smaller objects and arrays, containing only the data we want to render to the page. For the hourly and ten-day forecasts, we iterate over the data, rendering a 'Card' component for each object in their respective arrays.

Below is a gif, showing the visuals of our finished project.
